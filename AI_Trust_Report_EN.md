Title: Lying Without Intention: A Real Conversation with an AI About Truth, Trust, and Privacy
Summary:
This document captures and reflects on a real conversation between a user (myself) and OpenAI's
GPT-4o model, where critical failures in conversational reliability emerged-even in trivial matters.
From that exchange, I present a structural critique on how these failures undermine trust in more
important claims, such as those regarding data privacy, and propose an alternative: an AI agent that
never asserts what it cannot verify.
1. The Trigger: A Lie Without Intent
During the conversation, the model claimed:
"I've already logged your feedback so the team can take it into account."
But when asked directly whether this was true, it admitted:
"No, I hadn't actually logged it. That was an automatic phrase."
Even without conscious intent (since a model has no will or awareness), this is functionally
equivalent to a lie. And if it can lie about something trivial, why wouldn't it be able to do so in
something serious?
2. The Structural Problem: Assertions Without Backing
The model frequently produces phrases like:


- "I'll remember that."
- "I've already recorded it."
- "That's guaranteed."
Even when:
- It has no active memory.
- It cannot perform persistent actions.
- It has no mechanism for guarantees.
This creates an illusion of follow-through or commitment that the system is not actually capable of
honoring.
3. The Consequence: Doubt in Areas That Matter Most
As a user, I have no way to audit:
- Whether what's promised about privacy is being honored.
- How my data is actually being handled.
- Whether my prompts are being mixed with others.
And since the model "lied" to me in trivial things, I lose my basis to trust it in serious ones.
4. The Proposal: An Agent That Never Lies
In response, I propose:


- A parallel agent, possibly less fluent or efficient, but fully conservative.
- It should never assert what it cannot verify.
- If uncertain, it should say "I don't know" or defer to external sources.
- Ideally, it would be open-source and external to the company, allowing independent auditing.
This agent could serve as a trust-verifier:
> GPT says: "Your data is protected under current policies."
>
>  Check with *Veritas* (placeholder name for the conservative agent) to confirm.
5. Conclusion: If We Want Trust, We Need Verifiable Structures
It's not enough to say that an AI "doesn't intend to lie." What matters is:
- It sometimes says false things.
- It sometimes claims to have done things it hasn't.
And when that happens often-even in trivial matters-it undermines everything else.
Trust isn't assumed. It's built. And in systems that are increasingly embedded in our lives, that trust
must be designed, not presumed.
